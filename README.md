# university-domains

## Overview
 ```
I have developed an application where you can see domains and web pages of any university of the world. I have used Vuetify for designing this application.
First there is a drop down where you will be selecting the country and then another dropddown will appear where you can select the university and then the domains and web pages of university will be show.
